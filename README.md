# Snort IDS System

Welcome to the **Snort IDS System** repository! This project provides a comprehensive Intrusion Detection System (IDS) using Snort, a leading open-source network intrusion prevention and detection system. Our goal is to help you monitor network traffic and detect malicious activities with ease.

## Overview

The Snort IDS System leverages Snort’s powerful features to analyze network traffic, identify potential threats, and generate alerts based on predefined rules. This repository includes scripts, configuration files, and documentation to set up and manage Snort effectively.

## Features

- **Real-Time Network Traffic Analysis:** Monitor and analyze network packets in real-time.
- **Customizable Rules:** Create and implement custom rules to tailor the IDS to your specific needs.
- **Alerting System:** Get real-time alerts about suspicious activities and potential threats.
- **Easy Configuration Management:** Simplify configuration and management with provided scripts and examples.
- **Integration Support:** Compatible with various logging and monitoring tools.

## Prerequisites

Before installing Snort, ensure you have the following:

- **Operating System:** Tested on Ubuntu 20.04/22.04, CentOS 7/8. Other Linux distributions may require adjustments.
- **Network Interface:** Ensure you have a network interface card (NIC) available for Snort to monitor.
- **Basic Networking Knowledge:** Understanding of TCP/IP, network protocols, and IDS concepts will be beneficial.
- **Root or Sudo Access:** Administrative privileges are required for installation and configuration.

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vijaykumargowdakk/Snort-IDS-System.git
cd Snort-IDS-System
```

### 2. Install Snort

**For Ubuntu:**

1. Update your package list:

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get update
    ```

2. Install Snort:

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install snort
    ```

**For CentOS:**

1. Enable EPEL repository:

    ```bash
    sudo yum install epel-release
    ```

2. Install Snort:

    ```bash
    sudo yum install snort
    ```

### 3. Configure Snort

1. **Edit Configuration File:**

   Open the Snort configuration file for editing:

    ```bash
    sudo nano /etc/snort/snort.conf
    ```

   Configure network settings, define variables, and set rule paths as needed. Ensure the configuration matches your network environment.

2. **Set Up Rules:**

   Place your custom Snort rules in the `rules/` directory. Edit `snort.conf` to include these rules:

    ```bash
    include $RULE_PATH/local.rules
    ```

   You can find and download additional rules from the [Snort website](https://www.snort.org/downloads).

3. **Test Configuration:**

   Verify that your configuration is correct by running:

    ```bash
    sudo snort -T -c /etc/snort/snort.conf
    ```

   Resolve any errors that appear during the test.

### 4. Start Snort

Start Snort in IDS mode with the following command:

```bash
sudo snort -A console -c /etc/snort/snort.conf -i eth0
```

Replace `eth0` with your network interface. Use `ifconfig` or `ip a` to find your network interface name.

## Usage

### Viewing Alerts

Snort generates alerts based on the configured rules. Alerts are displayed in the console and logged to `/var/log/snort/`. You can view these logs using:

```bash
sudo tail -f /var/log/snort/alert
```

### Updating Rules

Keep your Snort rules up to date to protect against new threats. Regularly download updates from the [Snort website](https://www.snort.org/downloads) or subscribe to their rule sets.

### Advanced Configuration

For advanced features like output plugins, preprocessors, and performance tuning, refer to the [Snort User Manual](https://snort.org/documents).
